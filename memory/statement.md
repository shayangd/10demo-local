# 10demo-Local

## Venture Idea

## Idea Statement

B2B SaaS companies lose qualified leads due to demo scheduling friction. Prospects wait 42+ hours for generic demos that don't address their needs, while sales teams face 40-60% no-show rates and can't scale personalized demos without exploding headcount costs. The result: massive pipeline leakage from delays and poor demo experiences.

## Solution Statement

10Demo is an AI agent that delivers live, voice-led product demos on video calls 24/7—responding in under 5 minutes and actually clicking through and controlling the product in real-time while conversing naturally with prospects. Unlike static demo videos or scripted tools, it combines real-time UI control with conversational AI and CRM integration to behave like a trained sales rep at infinite scale.
