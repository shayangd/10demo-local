## Idea Statement

B2B SaaS prospects wait 24-120 hours (average 42 hours) for generic product demos that don't address their specific needs, while sales teams face 40-60% no-show rates and massive pipeline leakage due to scheduling friction and delays. This affects both B2B SaaS companies (sales teams overwhelmed with demo requests) and their prospects (frustrated by delays and generic presentations). The core tension is that prospects want instant, personalized demos on their schedule, but sales teams can't scale human reps to meet demand without exploding headcount costs. This matters because qualified leads are slipping away—not due to lack of interest, but because of a 42-hour scheduling bottleneck that creates direct revenue loss.

## Solution Statement

10Demo provides an AI agent that joins video calls to deliver personalized, voice-led product demos 24/7, responding in under 5 minutes instead of the industry average of 42 hours. What makes it unique is that the AI actually controls and navigates the real product in real-time (not static videos or scripted click-throughs), adapts dynamically to prospect questions and exploration paths through two-way interactive conversations, and leverages deep CRM integration for context-aware demos that know who the prospect is and automate qualification and follow-up. Customers will choose it because it solves both sides of the problem: prospects get instant, personalized demos on demand, while sales teams eliminate scheduling friction and no-shows without adding expensive headcount.
