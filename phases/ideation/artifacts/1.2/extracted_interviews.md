Summary
Walid Daniel and Ahmed discussed Optim's current lead generation strategies, which utilize LinkedIn, cold calling via an SDR company, and SEO-driven inbound leads, with Ahmed confirming they have four paying customers, three from their network and one from SEO, and acknowledged issues with unqualified SDR leads. Walid Daniel proposed an AI demo tool to replace the "schedule demo" button, function as an SDR for qualifying inbound and outbound leads, and answer questions, an idea Ahmed was strongly interested in due to problems with unqualified leads and missed scheduled meetings. Ahmed provided pricing feedback on the AI tool, suggesting willingness to pay $300 to $400 USD per month if it worked as described, and raised concerns about the tool's natural language, its ability to handle the construction industry's intricacies, and its potential negative reflection on Optim. The implementation plan involves Ahmed providing frequently asked questions and a product demo recording, with Walid Daniel also suggesting future AI applications for onboarding and continuous customer support to address Ahmed's key pain point of being too busy to conduct demos.

Notes Length: Standard
* Current Lead Generation and Demo Process Walid Daniel was curious about Ahmed's current lead generation strategies for Optim, and Ahmed confirmed they utilize LinkedIn for lead generation, cold calling outsourced to an SDR company, and inbound leads driven by SEO. Ahmed shared that they currently perform the product demos themself, but are in the process of hiring a salesperson. The SDR company schedules meetings, providing high-level information to Ahmed, who then conducts a product demo to assess fit.
* Customer Acquisition and Sales Metrics Ahmed disclosed that they have four paying customers, with a low ratio of calls and demos to customers because the SDR leads are not always the Ideal Customer Profile (ICP). Three of the four current customers originated from their network, and one came from an SEO lead, which involved a random company finding their website, creating an account, and buying. Ahmed mentioned they allow for free trials and automated emails before a demo, but their current marketing processes are underdeveloped, leading to considerations about replacing their marketing person.
* Proposal for AI Demo Tool Walid Daniel proposed an AI tool intended to replace the "schedule demo" button with an immediate AI voice demo that shares its screen, validates the customer's ICP, and addresses questions. Walid Daniel emphasized this AI tool could function as an SDR for both inbound and outbound leads, qualifying prospects, and even disclosing pricing if enabled, with the option to schedule a call with Ahmed only if the prospect is serious. Ahmed expressed strong interest in this tool, noting it could resolve issues with unqualified leads, scheduled meetings that are missed, and prospects forgetting why they scheduled a demo.
* Pricing and Business Concerns for the AI Tool Walid Daniel asked Ahmed for pricing feedback on the proposed AI demo tool. Ahmed stated that there is no price at which the product would seem too cheap and thus like a scam, but considered $15 USD per month a "bargain" and $100 USD per month as the point where it starts to get expensive. If the product worked as described, Ahmed estimated they would be willing to pay between $300 and $400 USD per month, comparing it to the $4,500 they pay their SDR company for three months of outreach. Ahmed's concerns included the tool potentially reflecting poorly on them, the language not sounding natural enough, and the AI's ability to handle the intricacies and lack of standardization in the construction industry, which is their target market.
* Implementation and Use Cases of the AI Solution Walid Daniel clarified that the AI solution is not limited to inbound leads and could be used for outbound as well, integrated with tools like Apollo or Clay.com to immediately present a product demo link. Walid Daniel also asked Ahmed to collate the 10 most frequently asked questions from their historical calls, which Ahmed confirmed they could provide. The implementation plan involves Ahmed providing credentials and a 30 to 45-minute recording of them demoing their web app. Walid Daniel revealed that the company they are cloning charges North of $500 a month and is a YC company.
* Addressing Key Pain Points and Future Features Ahmed confirmed that being too busy to demo is a significant problem, leading them to hire a salesperson, especially since time zone differences with North American and European leads are causing delays. Walid Daniel suggested additional applications for the AI, including onboarding and continuous customer support, with onboarding involving the AI chatting with a user with "insane patience" to teach them every element of the product. Ahmed expressed willingness to sign up with the competitor until Walid Daniel's product is ready, emphasizing that product-led growth is crucial, particularly for international outreach to the US.

Summary
Walid Daniel provided an update on the profitable status of 'better' and its shift towards Disrupt, a UAE-based venture studio, before discussing the sales strategy of Ahmed Khairy's business, which is primarily inbound and self-service, with demos reserved for high-value enterprise customers. Ahmed Khairy detailed the pain points in their enterprise sales process, noting a 25% conversion rate from qualified opportunity to close, but highlighted difficulties in creating urgency for top-of-funnel leads. Walid Daniel then proposed an AI demo agent to conduct product demonstrations and qualify leads, an idea Ahmed Khairy found appealing for its potential to address SDR urgency and language challenges, suggesting a viable price range for the tool.

Notes Length: Standard
* Update on Better and Disrupt Walid Daniel provided an update on the company 'better', noting that it is currently profitable, generating about $50k USD per month in revenue, and is now being run by a general manager (GM). They are planning to either buy back existing investors or convert them to scale the business as it becomes a dividend-yielding, profitable venture. Walid Daniel then discussed their move to Disrupt, a venture studio in the UAE, detailing that Disrupt was founded by three Pakistani brothers who built and sold Cloudways to Digital Ocean for $350 million, and they focus on building profitable, non-venture-backed businesses like Squatwolf, PureVPN, and Secure.com.
* Inbound versus Outbound Sales Strategy Walid Daniel asked Ahmed Khairy about the composition of their business, specifically the ratio of inbound to outbound sales. Ahmed Khairy confirmed that their business is almost entirely inbound and relies on channel partners and word-of-mouth referrals, stating that outbound is "almost not a motion for us". Walid Daniel found this highly interesting, as most other people they spoke to are struggling to crack inbound and rely purely on outbound.
* Enterprise Customer Conversion and Self-Service Walid Daniel inquired about the percentage of closed-won customers that went through a demo versus those who self-onboarded through platforms like Shopify. Ahmed Khairy clarified that out of 30,000 users, only about 100 people went through a demo, with the vast majority being self-served. Ahmed Khairy noted that demos are typically reserved for enterprise accounts, which represent high-ticket size deals. Enterprise deals, around $50k to $60k a year, require hands-on onboarding by a solutions team of about four solution engineers and three or four CSMs.
* Sales Process Pain Points and Conversion Rate Ahmed Khairy discussed the pain points in the sales process for enterprise customers, acknowledging that closing is "always painful," but stated that their conversion rate from qualified opportunity to close is around 25%, which Walid Daniel noted is ahead of the common benchmark of 18% to 19%. The primary struggle for Ahmed Khairy's team is driving urgency for top-of-funnel leads and converting "window shoppers" who request demos without an urgent need to buy into qualified opportunities. Ahmed Khairy admitted their team is "very passive" in applying pressure to close deals.
* Proposal for an AI Demo Agent Walid Daniel presented an idea for a tool that uses AI to conduct product demos in place of human sales development representatives (SDRs). The proposed tool would ingest a 30 to 45-minute demo video provided by the company, extract text and audio, and use an AI agent to present the demo conversationally in a Google Meet call 24/7, fielding questions and following guardrails such as referring pricing questions to a human expert. Walid Daniel explained that the AI agent would gather and understand the video content in chapters, allowing it to jump to specific sections upon user request, essentially acting as an extremely patient and customizable on-demand demonstrator that can handle qualifying questions.
* Foreseen Challenges and Pricing for the AI Agent Ahmed Khairy expressed interest in the AI agent for sales and demo purposes, particularly noting that it could address challenges such as the lack of urgency in current SDRs and the difficulty of finding SDRs who are native speakers in both English and Arabic. Ahmed Khairy liked the idea of customizable voices and languages, as well as the ability to add or remove qualifying questions to the agent. When asked about pricing, Ahmed Khairy stated they would not commit money until they could challenge the agent and confirm its quality, but suggested that a fixed monthly cost above $5,000 would be too much, and a price between $200 and $500 a month would be low enough not to worry about.

Summary
Walid Daniel and Ajinkya Tanpure discussed Ajinkya Tanpure's current demo process, noting that Ajinkya Tanpure, Pan, and Dhanraj conduct demos, with Ajinkya Tanpure handling high-converting inbound calls for discovery, despite the varying challenges each team member faces with different customer types. Walid Daniel proposed an AI agent, inspired by the YC company Kurumi and using technologies like Vappy or Bland, to handle demos, qualify leads, and potentially manage pricing, replacing the current "book a demo" process with a "demo now" button. Ajinkya Tanpure expressed concern that prospects might not feel valued by an AI agent and suggested the agent be positioned as a qualification engine, suggesting a "no-brainer" price of $20 per month and a reasonable price of $50 to $99 per month for the US market, while Walid Daniel shared that their target audience is Head of Revenue or Chief Revenue Officers, and Ajinkya Tanpure offered to introduce Walid Daniel to their Head of Growth and GTM lead, Shani, from spiky.ai.

Notes Length: Standard
* Location and Personal Update Walid Daniel and Ajinkya Tanpure greeted each other and confirmed their respective locations: Walid Daniel was at the disrupt.com HQ, and Ajinkya Tanpure was at the Bay Founders HQ, which Ajinkya Tanpure noted was less crowded because they found a new space. Ajinkya Tanpure also mentioned progress on their wedding ring, which was locked in after viewing 3D models and samples, requiring only 10 to 15 days for production.
* Demo Process and Challenges Walid Daniel inquired about Ajinkya Tanpure's demo process, confirming that Ajinkya Tanpure, Pan, and Dhanraj, along with a new person joining, all conduct product demonstrations. Ajinkya Tanpure noted that they deal with people who typically use scheduling tools like Calendly or cal.com, while Dhanraj struggles with older school accounting firms, and FAN handles larger clients, enterprises, CFOs, and financial controllers. Ajinkya Tanpure personally handles inbound demos from their calendar on the website, conducting approximately two or three, 30-minute demos daily, totaling about one hour of their time.
* Effectiveness of Current Demos and Discovery Ajinkya Tanpure indicated that their inbound demos have a high conversion rate, as they are typically speaking to Ideal Customer Profiles (ICP), and they use these calls for discovery, making them valuable despite the time commitment. Walid Daniel asked what the perfect demo solution would look like with a "magic wand," to which Ajinkya Tanpure responded that they would want to dedicate only one day a week for all calls. The team currently runs independently without a dedicated pre-sales employee, although Walid Daniel was interested in the salary range for such a position for context on market needs.
* Proposal for an AI Demo Agent Walid Daniel presented an idea for an AI agent to handle demos, using technologies like Vappy or Bland for voice, trained on Ajinkya Tanpure's end-to-end demo. This agent would replace the "book a demo" button with "demo now," handle discovery, qualify the ICP, and demo the entire product in detail, potentially allowing gatekeeping of information like pricing. Walid Daniel revealed that this idea is inspired by a YC company, Kurumi, which uses an AI agent that browses and answers questions in real-time during a demo.
* Feedback and Market Concerns on the AI Agent Ajinkya Tanpure's primary concern about the AI demo agent was that prospects might not "feel special or valuable," and they noted that current no-show rates for human-led demos are between 10% and 20%. Ajinkya Tanpure also worried that Middle Eastern ICPs, who are "behind on tech," might not like the AI approach, though Walid Daniel clarified that the disrupt.com product is being built only for the US market. Ajinkya Tanpure suggested that the agent should be positioned as a qualification engine to make their job easier by ensuring they only speak to qualified leads.
* Pricing and Implementation of AI Demo Agent Ajinkya Tanpure suggested that a "no-brainer" price for the AI demo agent would be around $20 per month, similar to Charpt's pricing, while a reasonable starting price might be $50 per month, with $99 being a fair price, comparing it to other sales enablement tools. For implementation, Walid Daniel estimated that the preparation work would only require a half-hour to one-hour demo video from Ajinkya Tanpure, along with limitations like when to book a follow-up call.
* Target Audience and Industry Connections Walid Daniel shared that their target audience is Head of Revenue or Chief Revenue Officers in the US, and they are seeking feedback from these types of roles. Ajinkya Tanpure mentioned a company called spiky.ai, which also appears to be in the same space, and offered to introduce Walid Daniel to their Head of Growth and GTM lead, Shani, to gather more insight. Walid Daniel asked Ajinkya Tanpure to describe their product as "building an AI SDR" when making the introduction.

Summary
Walid Daniel and Ankit Mahindru shared their professional backgrounds, with Walid Daniel highlighting a background in civil engineering and insurance before co-founding Adenda and Hela insurance and joining Disrupt, and Ankit Mahindru noting a decade in growth roles, including scaling user acquisition at Leap, and currently building Soma, a B2B SaaS product for performance marketing teams. Walid Daniel revealed their product idea for an agentic AI that automates product demos and customer qualification, addressing high no-show rates and scheduling issues that Ankit Mahindru experienced with the B2C demo-based funnel at Leap, which required about 100 people to manage the volume. Ankit Mahindru questioned the AI demo agent's ability to convert users compared to human agents given the high acquisition cost of a demo call, though they agreed that an acceptable price point for an AI product that improves conversions could be around $1,000 per equivalent agent slot, concluding with Walid Daniel offering to introduce Ankit Mahindru to their co-founder at Disrupt who is focused on ad automation.
Details
Notes Length: Standard
* Introductions and Backgrounds Walid Daniel and Ankit Mahindru introduced themselves and shared their professional backgrounds. Walid Daniel mentioned their background in civil engineering, moving into insurance, and co-founding companies like Adenda and Hela insurance before joining Disrupt, a venture studio founded by the team that built and sold Cloudways to Digital Ocean for $350 million. Ankit Mahindru shared that their background is also in engineering, which they disliked, and that they have spent about 10 years in growth roles, including at CRED, and scaled user acquisition at the edtech startup Leap from 0 to $90 million AR in four years across 30-odd countries.
* Ankit Mahindru's Current Venture Ankit Mahindru is currently building a B2B SaaS product called Soma, aimed at performance marketing teams. This product automates parts of performance marketing operations, specifically by setting up ad creatives on ad platforms like Meta, which saves teams from manually uploading numerous creatives. The product currently has 13-14 paying users, typically targeting teams that spend between $250,000 to $4 million a month on Meta ads and generate 50 to 1,000 ad creatives daily, with the key value proposition being a 90-95% reduction in the time needed for ad setup.
* Context on Walid Daniel's Product Idea Walid Daniel revealed that their product idea focuses on automating the product demo and customer qualification process using an agentic AI as opposed to a human, offering 24/7 service in multiple languages. This product aims to address issues like the need to schedule discovery calls by allowing immediate demo conversion and could potentially be done with an AI agent asking questions and showcasing software functionality. Walid Daniel's co-founder at Disrupt is working on a similar automation for ad launching across various platforms for the venture studio's companies, currently using tools like Foreplay and Creatify, which Walid Daniel suggested Ankit Mahindru's product might consolidate.
* Pain Points in Demo Conversion Ankit Mahindru shared that the main challenge with Leap's previous demo-based B2C funnel was the need to build a large team to manage manual touchpoints and push users through the funnel. Specifically, they noted a significant no-show rate for booked calls, which was 50% even with optimizations like reminder calling and automated WhatsApp messages. Ankit Mahindru indicated that to handle the volume, Leap had about 100 people exclusively doing demo calls and later introduced one-to-many sessions (mini-webinars) to cater to the top of the funnel, a solution they noted is not feasible in B2B due to sensitivity of information.
* Concerns about AI Demo Agents Ankit Mahindru expressed concern regarding the proposed AI demo agent product, primarily questioning its ability to convert users and meet the benchmark set by a human agent. They stressed that the acquisition cost for a demo call is high, potentially $200-$300, and risking a subpar conversion experience is a major drawback, even if the AI solves availability issues, such as servicing calls during off-hours. The buying decision would largely rest on how the AI agent performs compared to a human, noting that even being 10% worse could be acceptable at an aggregate level due to saved human costs and increased efficiency.
* Pricing Discussion for AI Demo Agent The discussion moved to potential pricing for the AI demo product at the scale of a company like Leap, which had a daily volume of about 700-800 demos. Ankit Mahindru estimated the cost of a human demo agent to be around $1,000 per month and suggested that if the AI product's value proposition is improving conversions, the company might be comfortable paying $1,000 per equivalent agent slot. If the main value prop was only reducing the cost of labor, a 40-50% markdown, or about $500 per slot, would be expected. Walid Daniel concluded that paying $20,000 per month for the AI product to handle 20% of calls and convert better than top human agents is not an unreasonable price point.
* Introduction for Collaboration Walid Daniel offered to introduce Ankit Mahindru to their co-founder at Disrupt who is focused on automating ads for their portfolio companies, as this relates to Ankit Mahindru's SaaS product Soma. Ankit Mahindru accepted the offer and agreed to send Walid Daniel a note and a link to facilitate the introduction.

Summary
Azim Hamza shared updates on their company's partnerships, including onboarding mid-enterprise clients like notion and signing Canva, and described their business model as a Palunteer model focused on analyzing client data and developing feature-level strategies for marketing teams, with a current focus on solving the pain point of understanding customer purchase behavior through anonymized data. Walid Daniel updated Azim Hamza on their profitable direct-to-consumer wellness venture, which is in talks to be converted into a lifestyle business, and detailed their new role as an entrepreneur in residence at disrupt.com, where they are focusing on fixing the B2B sales enablement funnel for B2B SaaS companies. Azim Hamza outlined their customer qualification strategy, focusing on medium enterprises with specific revenue and ad spending, and acquiring customers primarily through their co-founder's network, while Walid Daniel detailed their AI Sales Development Representative (SDR) concept, which would launch an immediate video call with an AI SDR trained on the product demo, with a target pricing model and an identified use case for Azim Hamza's large-team onboarding process. Both Walid Daniel and Azim Hamza agreed to collaborate, with Azim Hamza offering to connect Walid Daniel to the team at CL.AI.
Details
Notes Length: Standard
* Company Updates and Partnerships Azim Hamza shared that they are currently onboarding customers and integrating with mid-enterprise clients, including notion, which is their first large enterprise client. Walid Daniel congratulated them on signing Canva. Azim Hamza explained their approach is less of a Software as a Service (SaaS) and more of a Palunteer model, focusing on analyzing client numbers and developing strategies at a feature level to assist marketing teams.
* Business Model and Differentiation Azim Hamza elaborated on their business focus, which is currently on hold for B2B due to the availability of existing tools. Their goal is to solve the pain point of understanding why customers buy a product and building an analytics pipeline for it. A key differentiator is their ability to enable businesses to understand customer purchase behavior across different merchants by anonymizing data and providing insights on customer activity elsewhere, helping to address issues like positioning or messaging when churn occurs.
* Walid Daniel's Past and Current Business Endeavors Walid Daniel provided an update on their previous venture, which pivoted from men's care to general wellness, operating as a direct-to-consumer business focusing on products like showerheads and weighted blankets. Walid Daniel reported that this venture is now profitable, running on autopilot at around $50,000 USD per month in sales, though it lacks venture growth. They are discussing with investors to either buy back their shares or convert the business into a lifestyle one.
* Walid Daniel's New Role and Focus at Disrupt Walid Daniel has shifted their focus to disrupt.com, a venture builder founded by the creators of Cloudways and Squatwolf, among others, which is characterized by having no VC involvement. Walid Daniel is working there as an entrepreneur in residence, currently focusing on B2B sales enablement and fixing the B2B sales enablement funnel. Walid Daniel's target customer profile (ICP) for the new solution is B2B SaaS companies that require a product demo and are struggling with the funnel from demo to deal closure.
* Azim Hamza's Customer Qualification and Acquisition Strategy Azim Hamza outlined their customer qualification process, focusing only on medium enterprises based on their current revenue and targets, emphasizing the importance of maintaining their pricing. They also look at ad spending as a qualifier since their product is in ad tech and marketing tech. Azim Hamza mentioned that customer acquisition has primarily been through connections via their co-founder's network, and they also identify target industries with a strong identity or story, such as certain retail niches, to maximize product value.
* Walid Daniel's AI Sales Development Representative (SDR) Product Concept Walid Daniel is developing an AI SDR that sits at the demo stage of the sales process. The concept involves eliminating the typical form-filling and scheduling delays by immediately launching a video call with an AI SDR trained on the product's entire demo, similar to the functionality of companies like a specific YC company. Walid Daniel intends to pitch this idea to disrupt to validate it before building it and is not currently fundraising.
* AI SDR Pricing and Customer Onboarding Use Case Walid Daniel is considering a median price range for the AI SDR product, starting at $499 per month, with an additional half-dollar charge per video above a certain sales threshold. Azim Hamza identified a significant bottleneck in their large-team onboarding process that the product could solve through the creation of an onboarding coach agent. Walid Daniel detailed how this coach would be a patient, multilingual agent created by uploading a detailed tutorial video, which the agent would then use to segment and stream clips as answers to customer questions.
* Feedback on Walid Daniel's AI SDR Concept and Collaboration Azim Hamza expressed strong interest in the product's tutorial use case, noting its potential to address the heavy and complex educational needs of their large teams. Azim Hamza also mentioned similar tools like Arcade and pointer.ai, which use an agentic pointer to guide users through the product interface. Walid Daniel and Azim Hamza agreed to collaborate, with Azim Hamza offering to connect Walid Daniel to the team at CL.AI, a YC company.

Summary
Harsh Sajnani confirmed the public announcement of Kingpin's fundraising involving US-based VCs and provided an update on Kingpin's sales team, which is now entirely focused on outbound sales with a new Head of Sales, two AEs, and two SDRs, noting current AE conversion rates are about 15% and are expected to increase with a new product launch. Walid Daniel shared that they have joined disrupt.com as an Entrepreneur in Residence, where they are utilizing resources to develop new ideas, including an AI agent to automate product demos for lead qualification and support. Harsh Sajnani acknowledged Walid Daniel's idea as similar to the product One Mind and expressed a preference for usage-based pricing at a lower cost than the $2,000 to $3,000 range, while Walid Daniel also provided feedback on Kingpin's platform usability, noting issues with editing assumed user details and the neomorphic design.

Notes Length: Standard
* Fundraising Announcement and Kingpin Status Harsh Sajnani confirmed the public announcement of Kingpin's fundraising efforts, noting the involvement of US-based VCs from New York and San Francisco. Harsh Sajnani mentioned being in a stable state following extensive work to prepare for the launch, which involved fixing numerous bugs.
* Walid Daniel's New Role at Disrupt Walid Daniel shared that they have moved to disrupt.com as an Entrepreneur in Residence, where they utilize the company's resources in Pakistan to develop new ideas. Disrupt, described as a venture studio by Walid Daniel, was co-founded by three cousins who previously sold Cloudways to DigitalOcean for $350 million, and Walid Daniel is the first full-time Entrepreneur in Residence to join.
* Kingpin's Sales Team Structure and Strategy Harsh Sajnani provided an update on Kingpin's sales team, including the recent departure of Fasel and the hiring of a new Head of Sales, who manages SMB, along with two Account Executives (AEs) and two Sales Development Representatives (SDRs). Currently, Kingpin focuses entirely on outbound sales with zero investment in marketing, utilizing tools like Clay, HubSpot, Hey Reach, and Octave, with plans to roll out B2B partnerships and ads following the recent PR announcement.
* Sales Conversion Rates and Product Focus Harsh Sajnani reported that AEs currently convert about 15% of all booked demos into deals, which they expect to rise to 30% with the launch of a new product targeted at smaller brands with a lower Average Selling Price (ASP). They noted that the sales cycle for the new product is shorter, requiring only one to two weeks, and shared that the team collectively aims for around 100 meetings per month, although only 40% of scheduled meetings are actually attended.
* AI Agent for Demo and Lead Qualification Walid Daniel shared their idea of building an AI agent to automate product demos and improve lead qualification and conversion, similar to the product One Mind, which can send demos via email or handle video calls to present and qualify leads. Walid Daniel described the AI agent as being trained on a product demo video and capable of conversing naturally with prospects, addressing their concerns in real time. Their goal is to reduce no-show rates and increase the effectiveness of demos for companies with outbound processes like Kingpin.
* Pricing Discussion for AI Tool Harsh Sajnani expressed that they would prefer usage-based pricing for the AI tool, as opposed to a flat monthly fee, suggesting that $2,000 to $3,000 per month for "nothing" is too expensive. Walid Daniel noted that the pricing would likely involve a small base fee plus a cost per call or lead, similar to tools like 11x AI, to avoid sounding too expensive. Harsh Sajnani emphasized the importance of pricing because founders and startups are typically highly cost-sensitive.
* Feedback on Kingpin's Platform Walid Daniel used the Kingpin platform and provided feedback on user experience issues. They noted that the system makes assumptions about user preferences (such as shoe size, age range, and location) without allowing users to edit these details, which could limit the value of the recommendations. They also mentioned that the neomorphic design made it difficult to identify which buttons or UI elements were interactive, suggesting clearer design patterns.
* Closing Conversation and Platform Improvements Harsh Sajnani acknowledged Walid Daniel's feedback on the platform, explaining that the inability to edit assumptions is a known issue they plan to address by allowing users to manually update their details. They also acknowledged the design feedback regarding the neomorphic UI and expressed interest in improving these aspects based on user input. The conversation concluded with both parties agreeing to stay in touch and Harsh Sajnani thanking Walid Daniel for their time and insights.

Summary
Khalil Osman discussed the journey of their Fintech company, which offers digital bank accounts, digital wallets, and facilitates peer-to-peer and B2B payments in Egypt, noting they are currently engaged with major financial institution partnerships and preparing to relaunch after addressing regulatory and technical concerns. Walid Daniel shared their new position as an Entrepreneur in Residence at Disrupt and pitched an AI SDR tool that uses AI agents to automate product demos, qualify leads, and engage in multilingual conversations 24/7, to replace traditional demo scheduling. Khalil Osman expressed that the tool might be a better fit for B2B SaaS companies rather than Fintech, suggested pricing considerations at around $500 per month, and agreed to introduce Walid Daniel to their contacts at fintech companies like Paymob and Vezeeta to gather additional feedback.
Details
Notes Length: Standard
* Khalil Osman's Company and Current Status Khalil Osman provided an update on their company, which they co-founded with the Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) and a founding team of six people. The company is a Fintech platform offering digital bank accounts, digital wallets, and facilitating peer-to-peer (P2P) and B2B payments in Egypt. The team includes a fractional CTO from a FAANG company working part-time and members from various backgrounds. They are currently in conversation with a major financial institution partnership and preparing for a relaunch within two to three weeks after addressing regulator and auditor concerns about consumer risk and technical performance issues.
* Revenue Model and Past Performance Khalil Osman explained their revenue model, which is based on transaction fees, interchange fees from card usage, and a proposed monthly account fee of around 5 to 15 Egyptian pounds. Prior to suspending operations, they had approximately 15,000 users and were facilitating about $500,000 USD per month in transaction volume. Operations were halted due to feedback from their regulator and auditor, citing concerns about how consumer risk was being managed and technical performance.
* Walid Daniel's Role at Disrupt Walid Daniel shared that they recently joined Disrupt as an Entrepreneur in Residence, a venture studio focused on building companies with a profitable-first approach, with past successes including Cloudways (sold to DigitalOcean for $350 million) and brands like Squatwolf, Secure.com, and PureVPN. Disrupt currently operates seven portfolio companies and provides Walid Daniel with access to resources such as designers, developers, and marketers to build new ventures.
* Walid Daniel's AI SDR Product Idea Walid Daniel pitched their current idea for an AI SDR (Sales Development Representative) tool designed to replace traditional demo scheduling processes. The product uses AI agents that can browse the internet, view screens, and engage in lifelike multilingual conversations trained on a company's product demo. The AI agent can field questions, qualify leads by asking pre-set questions, and either convert or schedule follow-up calls with human sales staff, operating 24/7 without breaks and offering immediate demos instead of requiring prospects to schedule appointments.
* Potential Use Cases and Concerns for the AI Tool Walid Daniel asked Khalil Osman if they currently offer demos, noting this is more typical for B2B SaaS companies. Khalil Osman confirmed that they do demos but cautioned that the AI tool might be less useful for Fintech given the need for compliance, handling sensitive financial information, and concerns about potential AI "hallucinations" leading to legal or regulatory issues. Khalil Osman suggested the product would be a much better fit for B2B SaaS companies, especially those with high volumes of demos and complex product workflows.
* Pricing and Market Position Walid Daniel asked Khalil Osman for feedback on pricing for the AI SDR tool. Khalil Osman suggested that $500 per month would be a reasonable price for a company doing 50 to 100 demos a month, but cautioned that the upper limit would depend on the company's average deal size and the current cost of running demos with human SDRs. Khalil Osman highlighted that many companies now use offshore SDRs in countries like Pakistan or the Philippines where the cost per SDR is around $500 to $1,000 per month, so the AI tool would need to demonstrate clear value advantages to justify its cost.

Summary
Mai Medhat provided an overview of Supersonic's platform, which automates front-end development to expedite product launches for startups and designers, noting their focus on B2B sales targeting design-led and product-led companies, and discussing their sales strategy of enterprise sales with a reliance on founder-driven demos to understand specific design needs. Walid Daniel introduced their role as an Entrepreneur in Residence at Disrupt and described a proposed AI SDR (Sales Development Representative) agent product that can conduct product demos, qualify leads, and operate 24/7 to address challenges like demo scheduling, high no-show rates, and the difficulty of understanding user needs. Mai Medhat highlighted concerns about the AI agent's ability to understand nuanced product requirements as effectively as a human founder, especially for discovery purposes, but acknowledged its potential usefulness for lead qualification and smaller use cases, suggesting a price range of $200 to $500 per month.

* Supersonic's Business and Product Offering Mai Medhat explained that Supersonic is a platform designed to help product teams, specifically startups and designers, by automating front-end development to reduce the time to launch products from weeks or months to hours or days. Their target customer is anyone launching a product, and they have pivoted from a B2C model to a B2B sales-led model. Their sales strategy focuses on targeting design-led and product-led companies, with a new sales hire to support growth.
* Sales Motion and Demo Strategy Mai Medhat confirmed that Supersonic relies on live demos as a key part of their sales process because they need to understand the specific use case and design needs of each prospect. These discovery calls help them determine if the product is the right fit for the customer. The demos are founder-led, with Mai Medhat and the co-founder conducting about 10 demos a week. They also explored self-serve options, such as a product tour integrated into the app, but found it insufficient for their sales strategy.
* Supersonic's Pain Points in Sales Mai Medhat shared that one of their primary sales pain points is high no-show rates for scheduled demos. Additionally, they struggle to find enough time to conduct demos while also building the product, leading to trade-offs between customer acquisition and product development. Another challenge is understanding whether prospects are in the Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) before scheduling a demo, as not all inbound requests are a good fit for Supersonic.
* Walid Daniel's Entrepreneur in Residence Role Walid Daniel introduced their new position as an Entrepreneur in Residence at Disrupt, a venture studio based in the UAE. Disrupt has a history of successful exits, including selling Cloudways to DigitalOcean for $350 million. Walid Daniel now focuses on developing new venture ideas, with access to Disrupt's resources, including designers, developers, and marketers, to validate and build new products.
* Proposed AI SDR Agent Product Walid Daniel described their idea for an AI SDR agent that conducts live product demos on demand, rather than requiring prospects to schedule a demo. The agent would be trained on a company's demo video, allowing it to answer questions, qualify leads by asking pre-set discovery questions, and decide whether to convert the lead or schedule a follow-up with a human. The agent operates 24/7, supports multiple languages, and replaces the traditional "book a demo" button with a "demo now" feature.
* Mai Medhat's Feedback on the AI SDR Concept Mai Medhat expressed skepticism about the AI agent's ability to replace founder-led discovery calls for Supersonic, noting that understanding the customer's specific use case, design requirements, and product maturity is nuanced and difficult for AI to handle. However, they acknowledged the AI agent could be valuable for lead qualification, answering basic questions, and supporting smaller use cases where a full founder-led demo is not required. Mai Medhat also noted that for companies with standardized demos, the AI agent could be extremely useful.
* Pricing Considerations for the AI Agent Walid Daniel asked Mai Medhat for feedback on pricing for the AI SDR product. Mai Medhat suggested that a price below $200 per month might seem too cheap and signal low quality, while $500 per month would be on the higher end but acceptable if the product delivers value. They emphasized that pricing should reflect the value provided, particularly in terms of saving time and improving lead qualification. Mai Medhat also noted that if the product could effectively pre-qualify leads and reduce wasted demo time, it would justify a higher price point.
* Closing and Next Steps The conversation concluded with Mai Medhat agreeing to think further about the AI SDR product and consider potential use cases for Supersonic. Walid Daniel thanked Mai Medhat for their time and feedback, noting that the input would help shape the development and positioning of the AI SDR agent. Both parties agreed to stay in touch and explore opportunities for collaboration in the future.

Summary
Walid Daniel and Maral Kossa Ogli discussed Maral Kossa Ogli's company, One Mind, which uses AI clones of founders to conduct product demonstrations and qualification, and Walid Daniel's previous startup Better and his new role as an Entrepreneur in Residence at Disrupt, where he is working on a similar AI agent idea. Walid Daniel shared details about Disrupt's structure as a venture studio with profitable businesses, and both discussed the challenges of differentiating AI demo tools in a crowded market, with Maral Kossa Ogli highlighting that One Mind focuses on asynchronous video demos rather than live calls, and discussing the difficulties of maintaining natural conversations beyond simple Q&A flows.
Details
Notes Length: Standard
* Maral Kossa Ogli's Company: One Mind Maral Kossa Ogli explained that One Mind creates AI clones of founders to conduct product demonstrations and qualification, with the AI agent either sending a video or, in newer versions, conducting live calls. The tool aims to replace the traditional "schedule demo" process by allowing prospects to interact immediately with an AI version of the founder. Maral Kossa Ogli mentioned that the company is still in early stages, having started development about a month ago after initially building a different product. They currently have a small team and have begun outreach to acquire customers.
* Walid Daniel's Background and Better Walid Daniel provided background on Better, a direct-to-consumer wellness startup they co-founded, which initially focused on men's care before pivoting to broader wellness products like weighted blankets and filtered showerheads. The company is now profitable, generating around $50k USD per month, and is run by a GM while Walid Daniel has stepped back to pursue new projects. Walid Daniel shared that they are currently in discussions to either convert the company into a lifestyle business or facilitate a buyback of early investors.
* Walid Daniel's Role at Disrupt Walid Daniel described Disrupt as a venture studio founded by three cousins who previously built and sold Cloudways to DigitalOcean for $350 million. Disrupt focuses on building profitable businesses without VC backing, including brands like Squatwolf (men's activewear), PureVPN, and Secure.com. Walid Daniel is the first full-time Entrepreneur in Residence at Disrupt and is currently working on validating an AI agent idea similar to One Mind's offering.
* Differentiating in a Crowded AI Demo Market Walid Daniel acknowledged that the AI demo space is becoming crowded, with multiple companies building similar tools, and expressed concern about differentiation. Maral Kossa Ogli agreed but noted that One Mind differentiates by focusing on asynchronous recorded video demos that can be sent via email or embedded on websites, rather than conducting live AI calls. They explained that maintaining a natural conversational flow beyond a few questions and answers is difficult with current AI technology, which is why One Mind emphasizes pre-recorded demos.
* Challenges in Building Natural AI Conversations Maral Kossa Ogli highlighted the technical challenges of building AI agents that can handle natural, extended conversations without scripts. They noted that while tools like Vapi and Retell exist to facilitate AI voice calls, getting the AI to feel truly natural and handle complex, multi-turn conversations is still very difficult. One Mind's approach focuses on simpler, asynchronous interactions where the AI responds to specific questions using pre-recorded video segments stitched together.
* Market Validation and Pricing Walid Daniel asked about One Mind's pricing and target market. Maral Kossa Ogli shared that they are targeting early-stage B2B SaaS companies with founders who are stretched thin on demos, and they are considering a pricing range of $300 to $500 per month. Walid Daniel noted that this aligns with the feedback he has been receiving from other founders, with most suggesting a price range of $200 to $500 per month for an AI demo tool.
* Closing and Next Steps Both Walid Daniel and Maral Kossa Ogli agreed that the market for AI demo agents is still in its early stages and that there is significant opportunity despite the increasing number of competitors. Walid Daniel expressed interest in staying in touch and potentially collaborating or sharing insights as they both develop products in this space. Maral Kossa Ogli thanked Walid Daniel for the conversation and agreed to keep in touch.

Summary
Walid Daniel and Salim Sraj discussed their recent professional updates, with Walid Daniel sharing their new role as an Entrepreneur in Residence at Disrupt, a venture studio focused on building profitable businesses, and Salim Sraj providing an update on their work with Halal Tourism, which is transitioning from a marketplace model to a B2B SaaS product for hotels. Walid Daniel presented an idea for an AI-powered demo agent to replace traditional demo booking processes, which Salim Sraj found interesting but noted would not currently fit Halal Tourism's needs due to their focus on shifting to a SaaS model and lack of current demo volume. Salim Sraj provided pricing feedback, suggesting a range of $200-$300 per month as reasonable for AI demo tools and agreed to introduce Walid Daniel to potential connections in the B2B SaaS space for further validation.
Details
Notes Length: Standard
* Professional Updates and Walid Daniel's New Role Walid Daniel shared that they recently joined Disrupt as an Entrepreneur in Residence, a venture studio founded by the team behind Cloudways (sold to DigitalOcean for $350 million) and other successful ventures like Squatwolf and PureVPN. Disrupt focuses on building profitable businesses without VC funding. Walid Daniel clarified that Better, their previous company, is now profitable and operating with a GM while they explore new ventures at Disrupt.
* Salim Sraj's Work with Halal Tourism Salim Sraj provided an update on Halal Tourism, explaining that they are transitioning the business from a marketplace model (which was not working) to a B2B SaaS product targeted at hotels. The product aims to help hotels better serve Muslim travelers by offering features like prayer times, Qibla direction, halal food information, and mosque locations. Salim Sraj noted that they are currently in the process of validating this new direction and reaching out to potential hotel clients.
* Walid Daniel's AI Demo Agent Concept Walid Daniel described their current idea for an AI-powered demo agent that would replace the traditional "schedule a demo" button with an immediate AI-led demo. The agent would be trained on a product demo video and could conduct live demos, qualify leads, answer questions, and determine whether to schedule a follow-up with a human or continue nurturing the lead. Walid Daniel emphasized that the tool would operate 24/7, support multiple languages, and reduce no-show rates.
* Salim Sraj's Feedback on the AI Demo Tool Salim Sraj found the idea interesting and noted it would be particularly useful for companies conducting high volumes of demos, but acknowledged it would not currently fit Halal Tourism's needs because they are just beginning to shift to a B2B SaaS model and do not yet have significant demo volume. Salim Sraj also expressed some skepticism about whether AI could fully replicate the human touch needed in discovery calls, especially for understanding nuanced customer needs.
* Pricing Feedback for the AI Demo Agent Walid Daniel asked Salim Sraj for feedback on pricing for the AI demo tool. Salim Sraj suggested that a price range of $200-$300 per month would be reasonable, particularly for startups or small businesses conducting 10-20 demos per month. They noted that pricing below $100 might seem too cheap, while pricing above $500 would need strong justification through clear ROI or time savings. Salim Sraj also mentioned that usage-based pricing (per demo or per lead) could be an attractive alternative to flat monthly fees.
* Potential Market and Connections Salim Sraj agreed to introduce Walid Daniel to contacts in the B2B SaaS space who might benefit from an AI demo tool and could provide additional validation feedback. They mentioned knowing a few founders running SaaS businesses who conduct regular demos and might be interested in exploring the tool. Walid Daniel thanked Salim Sraj and asked them to facilitate introductions via email or LinkedIn.
* Closing and Next Steps The conversation concluded with both Walid Daniel and Salim Sraj agreeing to stay in touch. Salim Sraj expressed interest in seeing how Walid Daniel's AI demo tool progresses and offered to help with introductions to potential customers or testers. Walid Daniel thanked Salim Sraj for their feedback and time, and both agreed to reconnect in the coming weeks.

Summary
Samer Diab provided an update on their company's revenue growth and shift toward serving enterprise clients, noting they now have over 100 paying customers and are conducting approximately 30 to 40 demos per week, with demo scheduling and qualification as a significant pain point. Walid Daniel shared details about their new role as an Entrepreneur in Residence at Disrupt, a venture studio, and presented an idea for an AI-powered demo agent that can conduct live product demonstrations, qualify leads, and operate 24/7 in multiple languages, inspired by companies like Kurumi and using technology platforms like Vapi or Bland. Samer Diab expressed strong interest in the concept, identified it as addressing a critical pain point for their team, and suggested pricing feedback indicating willingness to pay $200-$500 per month depending on demo volume, with usage-based pricing being an attractive model.
Details
Notes Length: Standard
* Samer Diab's Company Update Samer Diab shared that their company is experiencing significant growth, now serving over 100 paying customers and generating increasing monthly recurring revenue (MRR). They noted a shift toward targeting enterprise clients rather than smaller businesses, as enterprise clients have larger budgets and higher deal sizes. Samer Diab also mentioned that they are in the process of building out a more structured sales team to support this growth, including hiring additional sales representatives and a sales manager.
* Demo Process and Pain Points Samer Diab explained that their sales process is heavily demo-driven, with the team conducting approximately 30 to 40 product demos per week. The demos are essential for closing deals, especially with enterprise clients who require a more hands-on sales approach. Samer Diab identified several pain points in the current demo process, including high no-show rates (around 20-30%), difficulty scheduling demos across different time zones, and the time-consuming nature of conducting so many demos manually.
* Qualification Challenges Samer Diab noted that many of the demo requests they receive are from unqualified leads who are not a good fit for their product, which wastes valuable time and resources. They emphasized the need for better lead qualification before demos are scheduled, as this would allow the sales team to focus their efforts on high-value prospects. Samer Diab mentioned that they currently use basic qualification forms, but these are not always effective at filtering out unqualified leads.
* Walid Daniel's Role at Disrupt Walid Daniel provided context on their new position as an Entrepreneur in Residence at Disrupt, a venture studio founded by the team that built and sold Cloudways to DigitalOcean for $350 million. Disrupt focuses on building profitable businesses without relying on venture capital funding, and Walid Daniel now has access to resources like designers, developers, and marketers to develop and validate new business ideas. Walid Daniel shared that they are currently exploring ideas in the B2B sales enablement space.
* AI-Powered Demo Agent Concept Walid Daniel described their idea for an AI-powered demo agent that would replace the traditional "book a demo" process with an immediate, on-demand AI-led demo. The agent would be trained on a company's product demo video and could conduct live demos, answer questions, qualify leads by asking pre-set questions, and decide whether to schedule a follow-up with a human sales representative or continue nurturing the lead. Walid Daniel explained that the tool would operate 24/7, support multiple languages, and help reduce no-show rates by providing instant access to demos.
* Technology and Inspiration Walid Daniel mentioned that the AI demo agent idea is inspired by companies like Kurumi, a Y Combinator-backed startup, and would use voice AI platforms like Vapi or Bland to enable natural, conversational interactions. The agent would be capable of screen sharing, navigating through the product, and responding to user questions in real time, making it feel more like a conversation with a human sales representative than a scripted chatbot.
* Samer Diab's Feedback on the AI Demo Tool Samer Diab expressed strong interest in the AI demo agent concept, noting that it directly addresses several of their current pain points, including high demo volume, no-show rates, and unqualified leads. They emphasized that the ability to provide instant demos without requiring prospects to schedule a time would be a major advantage, particularly for international prospects in different time zones. Samer Diab also liked the idea of the AI agent handling initial qualification before escalating to a human sales representative.
* Pricing Feedback Walid Daniel asked Samer Diab for feedback on pricing for the AI demo tool. Samer Diab suggested that a price range of $200-$500 per month would be reasonable for a company conducting 30-40 demos per week, depending on the value provided. They noted that if the tool could significantly reduce the time spent on demos and improve lead qualification, it would easily justify the cost. Samer Diab also mentioned that usage-based pricing (per demo or per qualified lead) could be an attractive model, as it would align the cost with the value delivered.
* Closing and Next Steps The conversation concluded with Samer Diab expressing eagerness to see a demo of the AI agent once it is built and offering to provide further feedback or become an early tester. Walid Daniel thanked Samer Diab for their time and insights, noting that the feedback would be valuable in shaping the product. Both agreed to stay in touch and explore potential collaboration opportunities in the future.

Summary
Vaibhav Kashyap provided an overview of One Mind, an AI-powered video sales agent that creates personalized demo videos and conducts live calls to qualify leads and book meetings, noting they have onboarded about 40 customers since launching three weeks ago, primarily through outbound efforts. Walid Daniel shared background on their role as an Entrepreneur in Residence at Disrupt, a venture studio, and revealed they are working on a similar AI demo agent concept, which led to a discussion about overlapping ideas and market positioning. Vaibhav Kashyap acknowledged the competitive landscape, including companies like Tavus, Posh, and Second Nature, and discussed One Mind's focus on both async video demos and live AI calls, with pricing starting at $300 per month for async and $1,000 per month for live call capabilities.
Details
Notes Length: Standard
* One Mind's Product and Features Vaibhav Kashyap explained that One Mind is an AI-powered video sales agent designed to replace traditional sales development representatives (SDRs) by creating personalized demo videos and conducting live qualification calls. The tool allows companies to upload a demo video, which the AI then uses to generate customized demos for prospects. The AI can also conduct live voice calls to answer questions, qualify leads, and book meetings with human sales representatives. Vaibhav Kashyap emphasized that the goal is to provide immediate demos to prospects rather than requiring them to schedule a meeting.
* Customer Traction and Launch Vaibhav Kashyap shared that One Mind launched about three weeks ago and has already onboarded approximately 40 customers, primarily through outbound sales efforts. They noted that most customers are early-stage B2B SaaS companies with small sales teams who are looking to scale their demo process without hiring additional SDRs. Vaibhav Kashyap mentioned that the product is still evolving based on customer feedback, with new features being added regularly.
* Walid Daniel's Role at Disrupt Walid Daniel provided context on their position as an Entrepreneur in Residence at Disrupt, a venture studio founded by the team that built and sold Cloudways to DigitalOcean for $350 million. Disrupt focuses on building profitable, non-VC-backed businesses, and Walid Daniel now has access to resources like developers, designers, and marketers to build and validate new ideas. Walid Daniel explained that they are currently exploring opportunities in the B2B sales enablement space.
* Overlapping Ideas and Market Positioning Walid Daniel acknowledged that they are working on a similar AI demo agent concept, which led to a candid discussion about the competitive landscape and how both products might coexist in the market. Vaibhav Kashyap noted that there are several competitors in the space, including Tavus, Posh, and Second Nature, but emphasized that the market is large enough to support multiple players. Vaibhav Kashyap also pointed out that differentiation comes down to execution, features, and go-to-market strategy.
* Async Video Demos vs. Live AI Calls Vaibhav Kashyap explained that One Mind offers both asynchronous video demos (where the AI sends a pre-recorded, personalized video via email) and live AI calls (where the AI conducts a real-time conversation with the prospect). They noted that async video demos are easier to implement and have proven effective for top-of-funnel engagement, while live AI calls are more complex but provide a more interactive experience. Walid Daniel expressed interest in the live call functionality, noting that this aligns closely with their own product vision.
* Pricing Structure Vaibhav Kashyap shared that One Mind's pricing starts at $300 per month for async video demos, with an additional charge for live AI call capabilities, which brings the total to around $1,000 per month. They explained that the pricing is designed to be affordable for early-stage startups while still reflecting the value provided. Vaibhav Kashyap also mentioned that they are exploring usage-based pricing models, where customers pay per demo or per qualified lead, as an alternative to flat monthly fees.
* Challenges in Building AI Demo Agents Vaibhav Kashyap discussed some of the technical challenges involved in building AI demo agents, including ensuring natural conversational flow, handling edge cases where the AI doesn't understand a question, and preventing "hallucinations" where the AI provides incorrect information. They noted that maintaining quality and reliability is critical, as a single bad experience with the AI can damage a company's reputation. Vaibhav Kashyap emphasized that One Mind uses guardrails and fallback mechanisms to address these issues.
* Market Size and Opportunity Both Walid Daniel and Vaibhav Kashyap agreed that the market for AI demo agents is large and growing, driven by the increasing cost and difficulty of hiring SDRs, as well as the demand for instant, on-demand product demos. Vaibhav Kashyap noted that the total addressable market (TAM) includes any B2B SaaS company that conducts product demos, which encompasses thousands of potential customers. They also discussed the potential for expanding beyond demos into other areas like customer onboarding and support.
* Closing and Next Steps The conversation concluded with both Walid Daniel and Vaibhav Kashyap acknowledging the overlap in their product ideas and agreeing to stay in touch. Vaibhav Kashyap expressed openness to sharing insights and learning from each other's progress, noting that collaboration and knowledge-sharing can benefit both companies. Walid Daniel thanked Vaibhav Kashyap for the candid conversation and expressed interest in following One Mind's growth.
