    "verdict_rationale": "10Demo passes 5/6 core KPIs (ICP Reachability, Scalable Channels, Blended CAC, Market Timing, Competitive Intensity) and has 1 uncertain KPI (Conversion Complexity). The venture shows strong GTM feasibility fundamentals: Easy ICP access through 5+ channels, 6 scalable acquisition channels identified, favorable blended CAC of $850 (mature state), moderate market timing tailwinds, and medium competitive intensity with significant AI voice differentiation. However, specific constraints exist: (1) Conversion complexity of 7/10 indicates moderate-high sales friction due to AI quality concerns (72.7% of interviewees), rep adoption resistance, security reviews, and integration requirements. (2) Year 1 economics will be challenging with higher CAC ($1,500-2,500) before organic channels mature. (3) Success heavily depends on PLG motion working (free trial converting skeptics through 'see it to believe it'). (4) Must differentiate on 'AI voice' positioning rather than compete on generic 'demo automation' where incumbents dominate. With focused execution on recommended channels (PLG 40%, SEO 40%, G2/Capterra 20%), proactive addressing of conversion barriers (generous free trial, case studies, security docs), and AI-native positioning, 10Demo can achieve GTM success despite constraints. Verdict: Proceed with GTM, but acknowledge Year 1-2 will require capital for channel development and conversion optimization before unit economics reach steady state."
