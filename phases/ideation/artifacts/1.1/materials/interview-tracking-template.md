# Interview Tracking Template - Recipe 1.1

**Purpose**: Track responses from 10-15 customer discovery interviews to calculate KPIs (I1.1-I1.10)

**Instructions**:
1. Complete one row per interview immediately after the conversation
2. Use exact quotes where possible (especially for pain points and objections)
3. Fill in all numeric scores (0-10 for pain, 1-5 for purchase intent)
4. After 10-15 interviews, aggregate data to calculate Recipe 1.1 KPIs

## Analysis Tips

### After 5 Interviews (Mid-Point Check)

Ask yourself:
1. **Is the pain real and severe?** Average pain ≥7?
2. **Is the problem recent?** ≥75% experienced it in last 30 days?
3. **Are people trying to solve it?** ≥70% have workarounds?
4. **Do they like the solution concept?** ≥70% positive resonance?
5. **Are patterns emerging?** Common objections, pricing expectations, use cases?

**If NO to 2+ questions**: Consider pivoting ICP or solution positioning before completing all 15 interviews.

### After 10-15 Interviews (Final Analysis)

1. **Calculate all KPIs** (I1.1-I1.10)
2. **Segment by persona**: Which persona has strongest pain/purchase intent?
3. **Identify patterns**:
   - Top 3 pain points (verbatim quotes)
   - Top 3 objections (and how addressable)
   - Pricing sweet spot (Van Westendorp analysis)
   - Desired features (MVP vs. nice-to-have)
4. **Decide GO/CONDITIONAL/NO-GO**:
   - **GO**: ≥8 of 10 KPIs pass, strong purchase intent
   - **CONDITIONAL**: 5-7 KPIs pass, needs iteration on ICP or positioning
   - **NO-GO**: <5 KPIs pass, weak pain or purchase intent

### Red Flags That Should Trigger a Pivot

- Average pain intensity <6/10
- <50% have active workarounds
- <50% experienced problem in last 30 days
- Universal objection that can't be solved (e.g., "we'd never use AI for this")
- Van Westendorp pricing ≤ $100/month (not enough willingness to pay for B2B SaaS)

### Green Flags That Signal Strong Product-Market Fit

- Average pain intensity ≥8/10
- ≥80% have active workarounds (and hate them)
- ≥90% experienced problem in last 7 days
- Unprompted requests to pilot ("when can I try this?")
- Van Westendorp pricing converges ≥ $500/month (strong willingness to pay)
- Multiple referrals per interview (network effect)

## Export Instructions

After completing analysis:

1. **Export KPI data** to JSON format for Recipe 1.1 (see `kpis.json` schema)
2. **Write artifact summary** (see `artifact.md`)
3. **Share findings** with interview participants (keep your promise!)
4. **Decide next steps**: MVP scoping, pricing strategy, ICP refinement, or pivot
