## The Mom Test Principles

All materials follow Rob Fitzpatrick's "The Mom Test" methodology:

1. **Talk about their life, not your idea** - Focus on past behavior
2. **Ask about specifics in the past** - Avoid hypotheticals
3. **Listen more than you talk** - 70/30 listening/talking ratio
4. **Don't pitch** - Present solution neutrally, listen for resonance
5. **Dig into emotions** - Pain > Features
6. **Ask for commitments, not compliments** - Pilot interest, referrals

## Key Reminders

🎯 **Your role:** Conduct interviews, listen deeply, capture data
🚫 **Not your role:** Pitch, convince, defend solution
📊 **Success metric:** Quality of insights > quantity of interviews
🔍 **Focus:** Past behavior > hypothetical future
💡 **Goal:** Learn truth > confirm assumptions

**Good luck with your interviews! Remember: the best interviews are conversations where you listen 70% of the time and uncover truths you didn't expect.**
