## The Mom Test Methodology

All questions follow The Mom Test principles:

### DO:
✅ Ask about specific past events ("tell me about the last time...")
✅ Listen 70%, talk 30%
✅ Ask follow-up questions ("why?" "tell me more")
✅ Let silence happen

### DON'T:
❌ Pitch your solution (except neutrally in Section 2)
❌ Ask hypothetical questions ("would you use...?")
❌ Lead the witness ("don't you think this is a big problem?")
❌ Seek validation ("do you like my idea?")

### Red Flags:
- 🚩 Compliments without commitment ("that's a great idea!")
- 🚩 Hypothetical promises ("I would definitely use this")
- 🚩 Generic statements ("this is a problem for everyone")
- 🚩 Future tense ("we're planning to solve this next year")

### Green Flags:
- ✅ Specific examples ("last Tuesday, we lost a $50K deal because...")
- ✅ Emotional language (frustration, urgency)
- ✅ Time/money spent ("I spend 10 hours/week on this")
- ✅ Commitment ("if you build this, I'll pilot it next month")

## Success Criteria

### GO Verdict
- ≥8 of 10 KPIs pass thresholds
- Average pain intensity ≥7.5/10
- Strong purchase intent (≥50% at 4-5/5)
- Clear Van Westendorp pricing convergence ≥ $500/month
- Multiple early adopter candidates (Q26 = yes)

### CONDITIONAL Verdict
- 5-7 KPIs pass thresholds
- Moderate pain (6-7/10) or moderate purchase intent
- Pricing expectations unclear or too low
- Needs iteration on ICP or solution positioning

### NO-GO Verdict
- <5 KPIs pass thresholds
- Weak pain (<6/10)
- Low purchase intent (<50% at ≥3/5)
- Universal objections that can't be solved
- Van Westendorp pricing < $100/month (insufficient willingness to pay)

## Next Steps After Interviews

1. **Aggregate Data**: Use tracking template to compile responses
2. **Calculate KPIs**: Compute I1.1-I1.10 per Recipe 1.1 specification
3. **Synthesize Insights**:
   - Recurring pain points (verbatim quotes)
   - Common objections (and addressability)
   - Pricing sweet spot (Van Westendorp analysis)
   - Persona fit (which personas show strongest pain/intent?)
4. **Decide**: GO / CONDITIONAL / NO-GO
5. **If GO**: Proceed to MVP scoping, pricing strategy, early customer pilots
6. **If CONDITIONAL**: Iterate on ICP or solution positioning, conduct 5-10 more interviews
7. **If NO-GO**: Pivot problem/solution or kill idea

## Key Insights (Pre-Interview)

Based on venture context, here are hypotheses to test:

### Expected Pain Points
1. **Demo scheduling delays**: Prospects wait 42+ hours (is this universally painful?)
2. **No-show rates**: 40-60% no-shows (do prospects confirm this?)
3. **Generic demos**: Demos don't address specific needs (how often does this happen?)
4. **Scaling constraints**: Can't hire enough reps (is this true for mid-market and enterprise?)

### Expected Objections
1. **"Prospects won't talk to AI"**: Test quality bar and disclosure preferences
2. **"Too expensive"**: Test willingness to pay vs. current spend
3. **"Integration requirements"**: Test CRM/calendar/demo environment needs
4. **"Security/compliance"**: Test enterprise requirements (especially Persona 4)

### Expected Willingness to Pay
- **SMB (Persona 3)**: $200-$500/month
- **Mid-Market (Persona 1, 2)**: $500-$2,000/month
- **Enterprise (Persona 4)**: $2,000-$10,000/month

Van Westendorp analysis will validate these ranges.

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: Low interview completion rate (<80%)
**Mitigation**: Over-recruit (schedule 15-20 to get 10-15 completions), send reminders 24 hours before

### Risk: Biased sample (only people who like AI)
**Mitigation**: Recruit from diverse channels, don't mention "AI" in outreach, ask about objections explicitly (Q11)

### Risk: Politeness bias ("that's a great idea!")
**Mitigation**: Follow The Mom Test rigorously, ask about past behavior (not hypotheticals), look for commitment (Q26)

### Risk: Inconsistent data collection
**Mitigation**: Complete tracking template immediately after each interview, use exact scoring scales (0-10, 1-5)
