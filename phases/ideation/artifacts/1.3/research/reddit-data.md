## Mentions

### Mention 1
- **Title**: "Book a Demo" button is killing your conversions.
- **Body**: "Stop hiding your product behind a 'Book a Demo' button. It's killing your conversions. What's really happening + What should you do instead of 'Book a Demo'... When potential users land on your landing page, they want to know (right away) if your product is for them. They don't want to schedule a call and then figure it out. They don't want to wait. They want to: See. Feel. Know. Right Now. 'Book a Demo' adds friction instead of removing it."

### Mention 2
- **Title**: "How I built this meeting scheduler to improve my own SaaS demo bookings"
- **Body**: "At my last startup, most people either didn't show up to demos or didn't book at all even after visiting the Calendly link. After talking to a few of them, I realized they just didn't feel like it was worth their time. It felt like a cold email with a Calendly link added on. So I thought what if you can add social proof, explainer videos, testimonials, reviews, case studies, whatever you need to build trust directly onto your booking page."

- **Title**: "Removed the 'Book a Demo' button. Conversions went up 12%."

Wasted 8-10 hours per week on calls that went nowhere. Tried something counterintuitive. Removed the demo button. Made the product fully self-serve with a 14-day trial."

- **Body**: "We eliminated ALL delays in our customer journey. Before: Someone wants a demo? 'Let me check my calendar and get back to you.' After: 'Are you free right now? I can show you in 5 minutes.' Before: Prospect wants to try the product? 'Let me set up a demo environment. Can we schedule for next week?' After: 'Here's instant access. Start now.'"

- **Workaround Mentioned**: Yes - instant demos in 5 minutes, instant access

### Mention 5
- **Title**: "How do you decrease no-show rate?"
- **Body**: "So, I manage performance marketing for a B2B brand. We are more of a sales-led company so demos are more important to us than signups. We are using Calendly on our landing pages. Anyway, so Google ads has been working great for us and lately we started experimenting with META ads. While the CPL for META is almost 1/4, the no-show rate is really high. To give you more context, for every 10 demos booked, 6-7 are no show which is really high because the no-show rate for Google ads is around 1-2."

### Mention 6
- **Title**: "How we plan on reviving ghosted buyers"
- **Body**: "For months about 60% of our first call prospects never booked again. No noes just silence. I think the issue is they don't really know why a second call matters or what they'll get from it. The idea is to make followups feel personal, specific, and easy to act on instead of another 'thanks for your time' email: Send a followup within 24 hours of the first call."

- **Title**: "We've done 100+ demos for our B2B SaaS but no one converts. what am I missing?"
- **Body**: "We've built a B2B SaaS product (automation/testing domain) and have done 100+ demos so far. Most prospects genuinely like what they see they say things like 'this looks great', 'that's interesting', etc. But the problem is: Hardly anyone signs up for a trial after the demo. Even the ones who do sign up rarely complete the trial or POC. It's been 8 months, and we still haven't closed a single paying customer."

- **Title**: "Quick question (First-time founder) - Demo to conversion metrics"
- **Body**: "We've been toiling away on repairing our sales pipeline and now have some steady numbers in the last two months: 1 salesperson schedules - 15 demos/month, 10 actually occur, 6 enter trial, 2 become paying customers. With these metrics, can we say that we're ready to scale by hiring additional sales reps?"

### Mention 9
- **Title**: "My website was making money while I slept, but I was losing 50% of my demos to time-wasters"
- **Body**: "Six months ago I was feeling pretty smug about my lead generation setup. Like, I'm getting 8% conversion rates on my landing pages, demo requests flooding my calendar, posting screenshots in entrepreneur Discord servers. Classic 'winning.' But then I started actually tracking what happened AFTER the demo was booked. 50% no-shows on average. Of the 50% who showed up, another 25% were clearly not qualified."

- **Body**: "Backstory I was about to double down on cold email and this is the reason I switched to a premium sending platform got everything ready and then the subscription fell through. Instead of waiting around I gave myself 48 hours to spin up a LinkedIn outreach system and almost 30 days later I have now sent 2.2k connection requests, 800 DMs and we were averaging reply rate of 40 to 60% and that alone booked us 79 calls."

### Mention 11
- **Title**: "Am I just bad at sales, or is this normal starting out?"
- **Body**: "I'm a 22M who just graduated college and have been interviewing for BDR/SDR roles. Last week, I flew out for a 3-day work trial with one of the fastest-growing startups in the U.S. The goal was to book 3 demos a day and if you got close or showed progress, you'd probably get an offer. Despite experimenting with different messaging angles, follow-up sequences (around 18 emails in a smart sequence), and targeting departments like HR, IT, and Finance, I'm still not getting solid traction (no demos booked, no leads worth mentioning)."

### Mention 12
- **Title**: "Sales tools that actually help book demos?"
- **Body**: "I've seen a bunch os sales tools like Copilot AI etc that claim to be your personal SDR and book meetings from with little to no input. Has anyone used any of them and do they actually work or is it another waste of money. For context I am a BDR and am willing to pay good money if I can automate a part of my outreach to book more demos"

### Mention 13
- **Title**: "How do you personalize sales follow-ups without creating 100 versions of the same demo?"
- **Body**: "After every product demo, I try to send a follow-up that recaps what we covered - something tailored to each prospect's use case. But honestly, it's becoming impossible to scale. Editing screen recordings for every lead takes hours, and sending static decks or PDFs feels lazy."

My rule has been for a while now let it dial for 30 seconds, if no pickup I hang up. I sell to small businesses. Main software I sell is $299/yr, since price is so low, try to demo it on the cold call by them reviewing my email and clicking on a link to try the software."

### Mention 17
- **Title**: "Why 90% of so called qualified prospects never buy"
- **Body**: "Most sales reps think their job is to convince prospects to buy. It's not. Your job is to figure out if prospects are actually ready to buy. Here's what's happening in probably 90% of B2B sales calls: Prospect shows up to demo - Rep presents features - Prospect asks good questions - Rep thinks this is going great - Prospect says 'let me think about it' - Prospect ghosts forever."

### Mention 18
- **Title**: "Lead response time demo booking"
- **Body**: "For outbound, the flow is usually: 1. BDR sets a meeting (usually from cold calls). 2. AE runs a 30 minute discovery/demo call. We block 60 mins on our calendars, but the customer expects 30. 3. If that goes well, theres almost always at least one more call looping in the rest of decision makers."

### Mention 19
- **Title**: "From 0 to €10K MRR with my SaaS (twice), what actually worked"

### Mention 21
- **Title**: "I Built a AI Voice Agent That Calls Leads Within 1 Minute of Them Filling Out a Contact Form"
- **Body**: "When I used to work retail sales, following up with leads was a grind. You'd get flooded with warm prospects but if you didn't get back to them fast enough, they were gone. Not because they weren't interested, but because someone else got to them first. So I built something to experiment with that idea and it's been surprisingly effective. This is an outbound AI voice agent for an HVAC company. The moment someone fills out a contact form, the AI calls them within 60 seconds."

### Mention 22
- **Title**: "Research for a product I'm building to help with booking calls"
- **Body**: "I'm building a beautiful Calendly alternative. I focus more on connecting vs transacting. Open door: it includes a higher converting booking page. You can present your product / yourself with a video background, for example. Email flows with reminders to decrease no-shows. What I've read is that the reason for no-shows is usually poor qualification."

### Mention 23
- **Title**: "6 Months of Cold Outreach, Low Response Rates & Burnout"
- **Body**: "I'm part of the growth team at a SaaS company. Our lead generation strategy heavily relies on LinkedIn outreach and cold calling using tools like Apollo.io. LinkedIn limits us to 150 connection requests per week and 50 InMails per month (with Sales Navigator). I reach out to 150 leads weekly, but with only a 20–30% acceptance rate, I get just 3–4 replies—some book a demo, others reject it. It's been 6 months of this slow, draining cycle."

- **Body**: "Just accepted a new role and I'll be doing the demos as well as calling the inbound leads (that expressed interest in our software and filled in details but didn't book in). How would you guys structure this call? My main confusion/question is that our software solves about 3-4 core problems, but I'm confused about how many questions I ask/pain points I bring out of the customer so I can secure the demo."

I'm in my 20s consistently get told I'm mature for my age, but in all reality I'm not a 45 year old seasoned, sales ninja, sales veteran, mature yet.

### Mention 27
- **Title**: "How are you using product demos in your sales funnel?"
- **Body**: "Curious to hear how you're currently using demos in your B2B sales process: Do you offer demos on your landing page or only on live calls? How personalized are they? How long does it take your team to prepare one? What kind of demos have actually worked and converted for you?

- **Body**: "Was booking plenty of demos. Not closing enough of them. 18% close rate felt low. Recorded every demo for 6 months. Watched them back. Tracked everything. Changes that improved close rate: Pre-demo qualification form. Added 5 questions before booking. Filtered out bad fits. Close rate on remaining demos went up immediately. Shorter demos. Cut from 45 minutes to 25 minutes. Less time to lose attention. More urgency."

### Mention 29
- **Title**: "The one change that increased our Booked Demos by 53%"
- **Body**: "We run a mostly self-serve, product-led growth model, but we knew some of our Enterprise prospects prefer a more hands-on approach before committing. So we decided to add a 'Book a Demo' button on both our Pricing and Features pages. Before that, we didn't have any dedicated CTAs for demo bookings. People would occasionally book after signing up, usually triggered by an Intercom message."

### Mention 31
- **Title**: "Is tech sales eating itself alive? Endless outreach, AI overload"
- **Body**: "Not trying to be dramatic… but tech sales feels like it's choking on its own tools. Everyone's using sequences. Everyone's using AI. Everyone's optimizing their subject lines, follow-ups, and CTAs to death. Every inbox is either protected by double email systems (internal/external filters), or it bounces back with automated 'we received your message' responses. Gatekeeping is automated now."
